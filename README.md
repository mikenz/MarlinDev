# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware
<img align="top" width=175 src="Documentation/Logo/Marlin%20Logo%20GitHub.png" />
 Documentation has moved to [marlinfirmware.org](http://www.marlinfirmware.org).

## Development Only

__Not for production use – use with caution!__

## In Transition

The files that make up the Marlin firmware are being reorganized to provide a more managable structure.

Since the 1.1RC1, the following changes have been made:

1) File Layout --
   The bulk of the code is moved into the hardware/marlin/avr/libraries/marlin/ folder.
   A trivial sketch that can be used to compile and upload the firmware is located at hardware/marlin/avr/libraries/marlin/examples/MarlinFirmware/MarlinFirmware.ino

2) Configuration Files --
   The configuration files are being reorganized. The configuration files from the Marlin 1.1 series are still available in the configurations folder.
   The procedure that you use to customize your configuration has changed. Please see hardware/marlin/avr/libraries/marlin/examples/MarlinFirmware/FirmwareCustomization.h for more information.

3) Coding Style --
   The formatting of the source code is now controlled by the [astyle](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html) program.
   The options which specify the style in use are found in the .astylerc file which is located in the top level folder of this repository.
   To reformat a file, run ```astyle --options=.astylerc <file_name>```.
   You will need to do this before committing the file to the git repository. Pull requests which do not conform to the specified style will be rejected by the automated tests in our Travis Intgration suite.

4) Compilation Support --
   The IDE_1.6.5 branch has the support routines to build the firmware using the Arduino IDE 1.6.5.  At the present time, this support is incomplete.
   If you need them, you can retrieve earlier support routines from the [RC branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RC) of the [Marlin Release Repository](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin).

The [dev branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/tree/dev) contains the most up-to-date Marlin code. When reporting any issues, please check to see if they are resolved in this branch first. But let us know if issues exist in tagged releases so that we can document and patch them.

## Testing
The [RC branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/tree/RC) contains the latest Marlin 1.1 pre-release candidate.

## Submitting Patches
Development patches should be submitted as a Pull Request against the [master](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/tree/master) branch

For the latest tagged version of Marlin (currently 1.0.2 – January 2015) you should switch to the [Release Repository](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin).

## Current Status: Reorganization of Source Files

Testing of the 1.1 Release Candidate is under way. Marlin development needs to proceed with caution while the structural changes being implemented here are completed.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/Documentation/COPYING.md) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
